# Release Notes - v1.0.1

**Release Date:** September 21, 2025

## âœ¨ New Features

*   **Bulk Summarization:** The news monitoring functionality now supports bulk summarization, allowing for more efficient processing of multiple news articles at once.
*   **Sequential AI Summarization:** To ensure stability and reliability, all AI-powered summarization requests are now processed sequentially.

## ðŸš€ Improvements

*   **Enhanced Logging:** The logging mechanism for the Gemini summarization service has been significantly improved, providing more detailed and insightful information.
*   **Monitoring Reliability:** The overall reliability of the monitoring script has been enhanced to prevent crashes and ensure continuous operation.

## ðŸ›  Refactoring

*   **Project Structure:** The project has been refactored into a new structure, separating the core logic into three main components:
    *   `src/api`: An Express.js API that exposes the summarization service.
    *   `src/scripts`: A standalone script for monitoring web pages.
    *   `src/services`: The core summarization service powered by the Gemini API.
*   **Codebase:** The entire codebase has been modularized and improved for better readability, maintainability, and scalability.
